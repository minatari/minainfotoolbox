### What language, library, feature, service, or tool does this example demonstrate?
⋅⋅*This example demonstrates the Matter JS tool. 

### Why would a web developer want to use this technology? What problem(s) does it solve?
⋅⋅*A web developer would want to use this technology if they were creating anything that could potentially deal with the laws of physics. Many applications involve games (both desktop and mobile), but learning tools or interactive features of a website could easily be applied. 


### Why might a web developer be cautious about using this technology? What limitations, weaknesses, or drawbacks does this technology have? Does it have an active development community or does it look abandoned? How many projects seem to use this technology? If there is a public GitHub repo for this, when was the last commit, how many open issues do they have, and are those issues being addressed?

⋅⋅*Because the technology is still in the alpha phase, there are several bugs to be worked out. For instance, when playing around with my program, I noticed that if I drag my mouse far enough causing the velocity to grow past a certain point, some of my object would fly out of the screen. I had researched how to fix this problem, yet found that this was a common problem that the creators were dealing with. 

⋅⋅*There is an active development community I found through both stackOverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28079138/how-to-make-minimal-example-of-matter-js-work "stackOverflow") and the issues page on gitHub, answered by one of the developers (https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/issues/5 "Issues"). There is also a public GitHub repo, which has been updated within the past two months to two years depending on the file. There are open issues and pull requests which seem to be being made, though maybe not at the cutthroat pace of other programs. 

### What is your example site/app and how does it demonstrate the value of your chosen technology?

⋅⋅*My example is a small game where the objective is to grab all the 'cat' objects and drag/throw them into a basket. This demonstrates the value of my chosen technology through the use of the physics they had implemented (such as `gravity`, `density`, and `friction`), and using the unique objects in the technology (such as `engines`, `worlds`, and `bodies`). I increased the difficulty of the game by creating barriers (rectangles) and blockers (circles) with varying density. I also shifted the gravity so that it was more difficult to drag the object down and fight the blockers. 

### How should someone run your example? If you have hosted version of your example, provide a link to it, but also tell us anything we need to know in order to get the example working on our own machines.

⋅⋅*One can run my example on their desktop computer. The link is provided in my turnin (link to my student hosting website) but other than that, there isn't much needed to run the program. I would plan to turn this into a mobile application because of the dragging/pulling feature, which may work better on a mobile device. 

###  If your example requires the installation of tools or frameworks, explain how to do the install and provide links to any download sites. If your example requires the execution of commands in the terminal, note those here. If it requires a local web server in order to work, note that. If it requires an account on some web service and corresponding keys, provide a link to the service and explain how to configure the keys.

⋅⋅*The only installation needed was the pull from *Matter JS* github repository (https://github.com/liabru/matter-js) in order to have the link to the Matter script allowing me to create the engines/worlds/bodies. For me, this was done in the terminal using the basics of git, which should be installed prior to begin work. 

### Where should a web developer go to learn more about this technology? Include links to getting started guides, tutorials, articles, or other examples that you found.

⋅⋅*A developer looking to learn more about this technology should check out the *Matter JS* website (http://brm.io/matter-js/), especially the Demos page (and corresponding CodePen) as well as the documentation page. 
StackOverflow was a huge hub of information (as it always is), as well as the issues page of the Matter JS repository.
